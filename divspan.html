        <p>In HTML,
            div tags are elements used to define parts of a document, so that they are identifiable when a
            unique classification is necessary. Where other HTML elements such as "p" (paragraph), "em" (emphasis),
            and so on, accurately represent the semantics of the content, the additional use of "span" and
            "div" tags leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.
            Where no existing HTML element is applicable, "span" and "div" can valuably represent
            parts of a document so that HTML attributes such as class, id, lang, or dir can
            be applied.

            span represents an inline portion of a document, for example words within a
            sentence. div represents a block-level portion of a document such as a few
            paragraphs, or an image with its caption. div stands for division. The
            elements allow semantic attributes (e.g. lang="en-US"), CSS styling
            (e.g., color and typography), or client-side scripting (e.g.,
            animation, hiding, and augmentation) to be applied.[1][2]

            div defines a 'division' of the document, a block-level item that
            is more distinct from elements above and below it than a span of
            inline material</p>

    <div style="width:600px;height:500px;border:10px solid rgb(119, 0, 255);background-color: aqua;margin:auto;margin-top: 10px;">
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;text-align: center;"><span style="color:red;background-color: black;">S</span><span style="color:green;background-color: azure;">p</span><span style="color:chartreuse;background-color: yellow;">a</span><span style="color:violet;background-color: teal;">n</span></h1>
        <p>The <span style="color:red"> element was introduced to HTML in the internationalization working group's second draft html-i18n
                in 1995. However, it was not until HTML 4.01 that it became part of the HTML language,</span> appearing in the
                HTML 4 W3C Working Draft in 1997.[4]

                In 1995, <span style="background-color: black;color:white"> was introduced to mark up any inline span of text, because 'a generic container is
                    needed to carry the LANG and BIDI attributes in </span><span style="color:white">cases where no other element is appropriate.' It
                    still serves that general purpose, although a much richer range of semantic elements have been
                    defined since then, and there are also many more attributes that may need to be applied</span></p>
